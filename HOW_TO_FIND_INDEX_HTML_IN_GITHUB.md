# How to Find index.html in Your GitHub Repository

It seems like you can't find the `index.html` file in your GitHub repository. Let's solve this step by step.

## 🔍 Step 1: Go to Your GitHub Repository

1. **Open your web browser**
2. **Go to**: https://github.com
3. **Log in** to your GitHub account
4. **Look for your repository** named something like:
   - `hostall-website`
   - `HOSTALL`
   - `hostall`
   - Or whatever you named it

## 📁 Step 2: Check If You're in the Right Place

When you open your repository, you should see:
- Repository name at the top (like `YourUsername/hostall-website`)
- A list of files and folders
- Green "Code" button
- Tabs like "Code", "Issues", "Pull requests", "Actions"

## 🔎 Step 3: Look for index.html

In the file list, you should see:
- ✅ `index.html` (this is what we need!)
- ✅ `app.js`
- ✅ `package.json`
- ✅ `.github/` folder (contains workflows)
- ✅ Various `.md` files
- ✅ Image files (`.png`, `.jpg`)

## ❌ Problem: If You DON'T See index.html

This means your files might not be uploaded to GitHub yet. Here's what to do:

### Option A: Files Not Uploaded Yet
If you only see:
- `README.md`
- Maybe a few other files
- But NO `index.html`

**You need to upload your files first!**

### Option B: You're in a Subfolder
If you see folders like `src/` or similar:
- Click on the folders to navigate
- Look inside for `index.html`

### Option C: Wrong Repository
- Make sure you're in the correct repository
- Check the repository name matches your project

## 🚀 Quick Solution: Upload Files to GitHub

If `index.html` is missing, you need to upload it:

1. **In your GitHub repository, click the "Add file" button**
2. **Choose "Upload files"**
3. **Drag and drop these files from your computer**:
   - `index.html`
   - `app.js`
   - Any image files
   - Any other project files

4. **Write commit message**: "Upload HOSTALL website files"
5. **Click "Commit changes"**

## 📝 What to Look For

Your repository should have these files in the main folder:
```
YourRepository/
├── index.html          ← Main website file
├── app.js              ← JavaScript file  
├── package.json        ← Project config
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── deploy.yml  ← Deployment workflow
├── README.md
└── Various image files (.png, .jpg)
```

## 🎯 Once You Find index.html

1. **Click on `index.html`**
2. **Click the pencil icon (✏️)** to edit
3. **Find line 14** with the title tag
4. **Add "| Live"** at the end
5. **Commit changes**

## 🆘 Still Can't Find It?

Take a screenshot of what you see in your GitHub repository and share it. This will help me understand exactly what's in your repository and guide you to the right location.

Remember: We need to find the `index.html` file in your GitHub repository to make the small change that will trigger your deployment!
