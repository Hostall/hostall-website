# 📁 HOSTALL GitHub Repository Structure

Here's the exact folder structure you need to create in your GitHub repository:

```
hostall-website/                  # Root repository folder
│
├── .github/                      # GitHub folder (hidden)
│   └── workflows/                # Workflows folder
│       └── deploy.yml            # Main deployment workflow
│       
├── index.html                    # Your website's main HTML file
├── app.js                        # Your JavaScript file
│
├── DEPLOYMENT_SETUP_COMPLETE.md  # Documentation
├── HOW_TO_CHECK_DEPLOYMENT.md    # Documentation
├── DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md # Documentation
├── TEST_DEPLOYMENT.md            # Documentation
├── PUSH_TO_GITHUB_INSTRUCTIONS.md # Documentation
├── GITHUB_UPLOAD_CHECKLIST.md    # Documentation (this file)
│
└── (other files as needed)       # Any other website files
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

1. The `.github` folder starts with a dot (.) - it's a hidden folder
2. The folder structure must be exactly as shown
3. File names are case-sensitive
4. The `deploy.yml` file must be in the correct location

## 💡 Easy Way to Create This Structure:

1. Use GitHub's web interface to create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - This will automatically create both the `.github` and `workflows` folders
   - Then you can paste the content of the deploy.yml file

2. Upload all other files directly to the root of the repository
   - All documentation files go at the root level (not in any subfolder)

## 🔍 How to Verify the Structure:

After uploading, your repository should look like this:
- You'll see most files listed directly
- You'll see a `.github` folder
- If you click into the `.github` folder, you'll see the `workflows` folder
- If you click into the `workflows` folder, you'll see the `deploy.yml` file
