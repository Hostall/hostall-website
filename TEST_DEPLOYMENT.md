# ðŸ§ª Test Your HOSTALL Deployment

Follow these simple steps to verify your deployment automation is working correctly.

## Simple Test Change

1. **Edit your index.html file**
   
   Find this line in your index.html:
   ```html
   <title>HOSTALL - Find Your Perfect Hostel</title>
   ```
   
   Change it to:
   ```html
   <title>HOSTALL - Find Your Perfect Hostel Today!</title>
   ```

2. **Commit and push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Test deployment: Update website title"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Check GitHub Actions**
   - Go to: https://github.com/Hostall/hostall-website/actions
   - You should see a new workflow run start automatically
   - Watch it progress through the steps

4. **Watch Cloudflare Pages**
   - Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com â†’ Pages â†’ hostall-website
   - You'll see a new deployment appear
   - It will show "In progress" and then "Success"

5. **Check Your Live Website**
   - Open: https://hostall-website.pages.dev
   - Look at the browser tab title
   - It should now say "HOSTALL - Find Your Perfect Hostel Today!"
   - If you see the new title, your deployment automation is working!

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. Your code change is pushed to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions detects the push to main branch
3. The workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` automatically starts
4. It checks out your code and builds the project
5. It deploys the built files to Cloudflare Pages
6. Cloudflare Pages updates your live website
7. The whole process typically takes 1-3 minutes

## Checking Logs If Something Goes Wrong

If your deployment doesn't work:

1. **GitHub Actions Logs**
   - Click on the failed workflow run
   - Expand the step that failed
   - Read the error messages

2. **Cloudflare Pages Logs**
   - Go to the deployment that failed
   - Click "View Build" to see detailed logs
