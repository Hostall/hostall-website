# How to Complete Your GitHub Commit

Based on your screenshot, I can see you're at the GitHub commit screen. Here's what you need to select:

## 1. Choose the Commit Option
Select the first option:

âœ… **"Commit directly to the main branch"**

This option is already selected (blue radio button) in your screenshot, which is correct.

## 2. Commit Message
Your commit message looks good:
- **"Create deploy.yml"** 

This clearly describes what you're doing.

## 3. Extended Description
This is optional - you can leave it blank.

## 4. Click the Green Button
Click the green **"Commit changes"** button in the bottom right corner to finalize your commit.

## What Happens Next

After clicking "Commit changes":
1. Your deploy.yml file will be added to your repository
2. GitHub will recognize it as a workflow file
3. The workflow will be set up in your repository's Actions tab
4. The next time you push code to your main branch, this workflow will automatically run

## Checking Your Workflow

After committing, you can check if the workflow was properly set up by:
1. Going to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
2. You should see your workflow listed there
3. It might already be running or waiting for your next code push

## Next Steps

After this commit is successful, make sure you have added all the required secrets to your repository:
- CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
- CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID
- SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

Without these secrets, the workflow will fail when it runs.
