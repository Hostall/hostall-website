# Where to Find Your index.html Files

## 📁 Files I Created for You:

Looking at your project, I can see you now have **THREE** index.html files:

1. **`index.html`** - Your original existing file
2. **`sample_index.html`** - A simple example I created
3. **`complete_index.html`** - The full-featured website I just created

## 🔍 Where Are These Files Located?

These files are currently in the **Youware workspace**, not on your computer yet. Here's how to access them:

### Option 1: Download from Youware (Recommended)

1. **For Paid Users**: Use the download functionality on youware.com

### Option 2: Copy the Code Manually
I can show you the content of any file, and you can copy it:
