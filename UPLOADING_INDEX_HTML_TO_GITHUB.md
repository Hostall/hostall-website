# What is index.html and How to Upload it to GitHub

## What is index.html?

`index.html` is the main file of your website. It's the first file that loads when someone visits your website. Think of it as the "homepage" of your website.

- It contains the structure of your website
- It includes HTML code that defines what users see
- It connects to other files like CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for functionality)

For your HOSTALL project, `index.html` contains all the structure of your hostel listing website.

## How to Upload index.html to GitHub

### Step 1: Prepare Your Files

First, make sure you have these files ready on your computer:
- `index.html` (the main file we need)
- `app.js` (your JavaScript code)
- Any image files your website uses

### Step 2: Go to Your GitHub Repository

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: https://github.com
3. Log in to your GitHub account
4. Find your `hostall-website` repository (or whatever you named it)
5. Click on it to open

### Step 3: Upload Files

1. In your repository, look for the **"Add file"** button (near the top right)
2. Click it and select **"Upload files"** from the dropdown menu

3. You'll see a new page where you can upload files

### Step 4: Add Your Files

1. Either:
   - Drag and drop your files (`index.html`, `app.js`, etc.) into the browser window
   - OR click "choose your files" to select them from your computer

2. Wait for the files to upload (you'll see progress indicators)

### Step 5: Commit the Changes

1. Scroll down to the "Commit changes" section
2. Add a message like: `"Upload website files for HOSTALL project"`
3. Keep the "Commit directly to the main branch" option selected
4. Click the green **"Commit changes"** button

### Step A6: Wait for Upload to Complete

GitHub will process your files. This usually takes just a few seconds.

## After Uploading

Once uploaded, you should see your files in your repository. Now you can:

1. Click on `index.html` to view it
2. Click the pencil icon (✏️) to edit it
3. Find line 14 (with the title tag)
4. Add "| Live" at the end of the title
5. Commit this change to trigger your deployment

## Common Problems

### Can't Find the Add File Button
- Make sure you're logged in to GitHub
- Make sure you're in your repository (not someone else's)
- Look at the top section of files for the button

### Files Too Large
- GitHub has file size limits
- If your images are large, try compressing them first

### Need Help Finding Your Repository
1. Click your profile picture in the top right
2. Select "Your repositories"
3. Look for your HOSTALL repository in the list

## What's Next?

After uploading your files, you need to:

1. Edit `index.html` to add "| Live" to the title
2. This will trigger your GitHub Actions workflow
3. Your site will be deployed to Cloudflare Pages
4. Then you can connect your `hostall.org` domain
