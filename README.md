# ⚠️ EMERGENCY WEBSITE RESTORE ⚠️

## ❗ What Happened
The nuclear cache fix page has replaced your main website! The fix reset page was uploaded as your main index.html file by mistake.

## 🚨 How to Fix It

### Step 1: Download Files
- Download this `website_restore` folder

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to your main website folder (where index.html is)
3. Replace the current index.html with the one from this folder
4. Make sure to commit your changes

### Step 3: Verify
- Wait for GitHub to deploy (3-5 minutes)
- Visit your website to confirm it's working again

## 📋 What's Included
- `index.html` - The complete website with real-time sync code
- All required functionality is preserved
- Real-time sync is still enabled

## 🚀 Real-Time Sync Status
Real-time sync is still enabled in this fixed version. When admins add new hostels, they will appear instantly on all devices.

## ⚠️ Important Note
- Only upload the `index.html` file, not the entire folder
- The README file is just for instructions

## 🚫 Avoid Future Issues
In the future, only upload the files specified exactly. The nuclear fix was meant to be uploaded as `reset.html`, not to replace your main website.
